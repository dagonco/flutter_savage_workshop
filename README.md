<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project

This project serves as a guide for me to carry out about 19 exercises to understand the operation of the different widgets, their properties and attributes.

Distributed in 10 branches that starts from `step_0` from the creation of the project to `step_3_2` where we will end our workshop. In the `master` branch is where we will find the project fully resolved so that it can serve as a guide to solve any problem during an exercise.
